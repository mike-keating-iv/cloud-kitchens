# cloud-kitchens
Simple origin-destination optimization and visualization of drone kitchen and randomly generated destinations.

Adapted from an assignment for the graduate class ISE 535 taken at NC State University.

## Problem Context: 
You have joined forces with a start-up food services company
seeking to establish operations in various U.S. cities. Their business plan entails setting up
rapidly deployable “cloud kitchens” in vacant commercial real estate locations and delivering
meals to service stations via large drones.
Your team has been hired to deploy your Python and IE skills to help guide the start-up
company about how to best serve your chosen city. To this end, your team will engage in
three main tasks: (I) gather, calculate, and store data related to the selected cloud kitchen
locations and sample service stations (II) construct and solve an optimization model that
determines what cloud kitchen will deliver to each service station so as to minimize the total
distance, (III) analyze and visualize the solution results.
